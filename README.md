# EECS498_labs

This repository is for labs from EECS498/598: [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/). I learned it by watching its released videos on YouTube. I skipped Lab2 and Lab3 because I had finished similar labs before in other classes provided by my university.

* **Lab 1**

  - [x] Q1: PyTorch 101:

    > The aim of this lab is to get me familiar with the basics of working with tensors in PyTorch and broadcasting.

  - [x] Q2: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier:

    > Implement a kNN classifier to get more familiar with tensor operations.

* **Lab 4**

  - [x] Q1: PyTorch Autograd and Building ResNet from scratch:

    > This lab introduced me to the different levels of abstraction that PyTorch provides for building neural network models. I used this knowledge to implement and train Residual Networks for image classification.

  - [ ] Q2: Image Captioning with RNN, LSTM and Attention:

    > This lab walked me through the implementation of vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs. I used these networks to train an image captioning model. I then augmented my implementation to perform spatial attention over image regions while generating captions.

  - [x] Q3: Network Visualization:

    > This lab walked me through the use of image gradients for generating saliency maps, adversarial examples, and class visualizations.

  - [x] Q4: Style Transfer:

    > In this lab, I learned how to create images with the artistic style of one image and the content of another image.

* **Lab 5**

  - [x] Q1: Single-Stage Detector (YOLO):

    > Finish the implementation of a fully-convolutional single-stage object detector similar to YOLO (Redmon et al, CVPR 2016). Then I need to train and evaluate my detector on the [PASCAL VOC 2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html) object detection dataset.

  - [x] Q2: Two-Stage Detector (Faster R-CNN):

    > Finish the implementation of a two-stage object detector similar to Faster R-CNN (Ren et al, NeurIPS 2015). This will combine a fully-convolutional Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a second-stage recognition network.

* **Lab 6**

  - [x] Q1: Variational Autoencoder(VAE):

    > Finish the implementation of a VAE on the MNIST dataset. This will allow me to generate new data, and to interpolate in the latent space.

  - [x] Q2: Generative Adversarial Network(GAN):

    > I need to implement fully-connected and convolutional generative adversarial networks on the MNIST dataset.
